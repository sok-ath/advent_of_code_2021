###### problem 7

# split to a single column of crab positions in a google sheet

aoc7 <- read.csv("/Users/seankuhn/Downloads/AOC\ -\ 7.csv")

# looks like [0,2000] is the relevant interval:

ggplot(aoc7, aes(x = crab_poz)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("distribution of crab starting points")

# first loop

grid <- seq(0,2000,1)
catch_df <- data.frame()

for(g in grid){
  
  aoc7$deviation <- abs(aoc7$crab_poz - g)
  fuel_consumed <- sum(aoc7$deviation)
  temp_df <- as.data.frame((cbind(g, fuel_consumed)))
  catch_df <- rbind(catch_df, temp_df)
  
}

ggplot(catch_df, aes(x = g, y = fuel_consumed)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("fuel consumed ~ rallying point")

catch_df %>%
  arrange(fuel_consumed) %>%
  mutate(rn = row_number()) %>%
  filter(rn == 1)

### second problem: update cost function to: first step costs one, second step costs two, third step costs three, etc.

# math says that this 'factorial, except addition' is equal to (n^2 + n) / 2
# so, can just apply this function to the deviation in the loop above

grid <- seq(0,2000,1)
catch_df <- data.frame()

for(g in grid){
  
  aoc7$deviation <- abs(aoc7$crab_poz - g)
  aoc7$deviation_transformed <- with(aoc7, (deviation + deviation^2) / 2)
  fuel_consumed <- sum(aoc7$deviation_transformed)
  temp_df <- as.data.frame((cbind(g, fuel_consumed)))
  catch_df <- rbind(catch_df, temp_df)
  
}

ggplot(catch_df, aes(x = g, y = fuel_consumed)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("fuel consumed ~ rallying point")

catch_df %>%
  arrange(fuel_consumed) %>%
  mutate(rn = row_number()) %>%
  filter(rn == 1)
